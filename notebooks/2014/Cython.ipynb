In some cases, though, we may need to write some performance critical part of the code in C/C++. Cython comes very handy in this case as well to act as an inerface between python and C. So our code has three layers now. The uppermost layer is in python which is extremely human readable and third layer is C while Cython is the sandwiched layer 2 between them.
